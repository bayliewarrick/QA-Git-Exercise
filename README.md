# QA-Git-Exercise
Create a new repo on github, cloning it down.
Create a feature-branch model that follows these requirements:


# Merge Conflict Task:	
you must have a main branch with 1 commit
you must have a dev branch with 1 commit
you must have a feature-"somefeaturedetail" branch with 1 commit

    Using a existing text [file] on dev:
    - Create two new feature branches from dev
    - Make changes to the [file] in both feature branches; ensuring both files are different.
    - Commit both changes to both feature-branches
    - Attempt to merge both these feature branches into dev with both changes
